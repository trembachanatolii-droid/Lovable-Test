  intro: 'On June 4, 2025, the United States implemented a dramatic escalation in Section 232 national security tariffs on steel and aluminum articles, doubling the duty rate from 25% to 50% ad valorem. This unprecedented increase, authorized under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, has sent shockwaves through California\'s import-dependent industries, particularly construction, manufacturing, aerospace, and automotive sectors. With the exception of the United Kingdom, which retained the 25% rate under a bilateral arrangement, all other countries now face the elevated 50% duty structure. The tariff increase has pushed average U.S. effective tariff rates to 11.2%, the highest level since 1943, fundamentally altering the cost structure for California businesses that rely on imported steel and aluminum products. As U.S. Customs and Border Protection intensifies enforcement of proper classification and country of origin determinations at California ports, importers must implement comprehensive compliance strategies to manage both financial exposure and regulatory risk in this transformed trade environment.',

<h2>Understanding the June 2025 Section 232 Tariff Increase</h2>

<p>The June 4, 2025 implementation of 50% ad valorem duties on steel and aluminum imports marks the most significant tariff escalation in modern U.S. trade history. This doubling of the previous 25% Section 232 tariff rate affects virtually all steel and aluminum articles entering the United States, with limited exceptions. For California importers processing goods through the Ports of Los Angeles, Long Beach, and Oakland—which collectively handle approximately 40% of containerized imports entering the United States—the financial impact has been immediate and substantial.</p>

<p>The tariff increase applies to entries made on or after June 4, 2025, meaning goods that were in transit or warehoused prior to that date may have been subject to the previous 25% rate depending on entry date. California businesses engaged in construction, manufacturing, aerospace, defense, automotive production, and countless other industries that depend on steel and aluminum inputs now face dramatically increased landed costs. Steel prices in California markets have increased by 30-45% since the announcement of the tariff escalation, with aluminum prices rising 25-35%, reflecting both the direct tariff impact and supply chain adjustments.</p>

<p>The policy rationale behind the tariff increase centers on strengthening domestic steel and aluminum production capacity as a matter of national security. However, California importers must now balance compliance obligations, supply chain continuity, and financial viability in an environment where imported steel and aluminum products carry duties equivalent to half their customs value. Understanding the legal framework, product coverage, compliance requirements, and strategic options is essential for California businesses operating in this transformed regulatory landscape.</p>

<h2>Legal Basis: Section 232 Trade Expansion Act National Security Authority</h2>

<p>Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 (codified at 19 U.S.C. § 1862) provides the statutory authority for the President to impose tariffs or other import restrictions when the Secretary of Commerce determines that imports threaten to impair national security. Unlike Section 301 tariffs (which target unfair trade practices) or antidumping and countervailing duties (which address unfair pricing and subsidies), Section 232 tariffs are imposed on national security grounds without requiring proof of injury to domestic industry or unfair trade practices by foreign governments or producers.</p>

<p>The Section 232 steel and aluminum tariffs were originally implemented in March 2018 at 25% for steel articles and 10% for aluminum articles, later adjusted to 25% for both categories. The June 2025 escalation to 50% represents an exercise of continuing presidential authority under Section 232 to adjust tariff levels in response to evolving national security assessments. The legal framework governing these duties is found in Presidential proclamations issued under Section 232 authority, implemented through U.S. Customs and Border Protection regulations and guidance.</p>

<p>California importers should understand that Section 232 tariffs are additional duties imposed over and above normal customs duties, meaning total duty rates on affected steel and aluminum products can exceed 50% when combining column 1 most-favored-nation (MFN) rates with the Section 232 additional duty. The tariffs are collected by CBP at the time of entry and are subject to the same entry procedures, liquidation processes, and protest rights as other customs duties under 19 CFR Part 141 and related regulations.</p>

<h2>50% Tariff Rate Structure and Product Coverage</h2>

<p>The 50% ad valorem Section 232 tariff applies broadly to steel articles and aluminum articles as defined in the applicable presidential proclamations. Steel articles subject to the tariff are generally classified under Chapter 72 and Chapter 73 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS), covering iron and steel products, articles of iron or steel, and derivative products. Aluminum articles are generally classified under Chapter 76 of the HTSUS, covering aluminum and articles thereof.</p>

<p>The tariff applies to both primary forms (such as ingots, billets, blooms, slabs, bars, rods, wire, plates, sheets, and strips) and finished articles (such as pipes, tubes, fittings, fasteners, structures, containers, cable, foil, and fabricated products). However, the precise scope of covered products is determined by specific HTSUS classifications listed in the presidential proclamations, and some steel and aluminum articles may be excluded based on their classification, end use, or physical characteristics.</p>

<p>Critical considerations for California importers include:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Section 232 tariff applies based on HTSUS classification at the time of entry, requiring precise tariff classification</li>
<li>Minor variations in product specifications, composition, or manufacturing process can result in different classifications with different Section 232 treatment</li>
<li>Derivative articles containing steel or aluminum may be subject to the tariff even if the primary material represents a small percentage of the finished product</li>
<li>Product exclusion processes have historically been available but are limited, time-consuming, and provide relief only for specifically approved products</li>
</ul>

<p>California importers processing steel and aluminum articles through the Ports of Los Angeles, Long Beach, Oakland, or other California entry points must work with qualified customs counsel to ensure accurate HTSUS classification, as misclassification can result in both underpayment of duties (creating liability for additional duties, penalties, and interest) and overpayment of duties (resulting in unnecessary costs that can only be recovered through post-entry refund procedures).</p>

<h2>UK Exception and Comparative Analysis</h2>

<p>The United Kingdom stands alone as the only country exempted from the June 2025 tariff increase, retaining the 25% Section 232 duty rate that previously applied globally. This bilateral arrangement reflects ongoing trade negotiations and strategic considerations between the United States and the United Kingdom. For California importers, the UK exception creates both opportunities and complexities.</p>

<p>Steel and aluminum articles imported from the United Kingdom continue to be subject to 25% Section 232 duties, providing a significant competitive advantage compared to products from other countries facing 50% duties. However, qualifying for UK origin treatment requires strict compliance with country of origin rules under 19 CFR Part 134 and related regulations. Simply purchasing goods through a UK intermediary or transshipping products through the UK does not confer UK origin for tariff purposes.</p>

<p>To qualify as products of the United Kingdom for purposes of the lower 25% tariff rate, steel or aluminum articles must be wholly obtained in the UK or substantially transformed in the UK under applicable country of origin tests. For steel and aluminum products, substantial transformation typically requires that the manufacturing process in the UK results in a product with a different name, character, and use than the input materials. Minor processing, assembly, or finishing operations in the UK will generally not be sufficient to confer UK origin.</p>

<p>California importers considering UK sourcing strategies must conduct careful country of origin analysis and ensure proper documentation. CBP actively audits country of origin claims for Section 232 purposes, and false or misleading claims can result in penalty assessments under 19 U.S.C. § 1592, potential exclusion from the UK exception, and assessment of the full 50% duty rate plus penalties and interest. The comparative 25-percentage-point duty differential between UK and non-UK products creates substantial incentive for origin manipulation, making this a priority enforcement area for CBP.</p>

<h2>Impact on California Construction and Manufacturing</h2>

<p>California's construction industry has been among the hardest hit by the Section 232 tariff escalation. Structural steel, reinforcing bar (rebar), metal framing, roofing materials, fasteners, and countless other steel and aluminum products essential to commercial, residential, and infrastructure construction projects now carry 50% additional duties. Construction costs for steel-intensive projects in Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Diego, and throughout California have increased substantially, forcing project delays, redesigns, and in some cases project cancellations.</p>

<p>General contractors, subcontractors, and construction material suppliers operating in California face difficult decisions regarding pricing, contract performance, and supply chain management. Construction contracts executed prior to the June 2025 tariff increase often lack adequate force majeure or price adjustment clauses to address the tariff impact, creating potential disputes over cost allocation between project owners, general contractors, and subcontractors. California construction companies importing steel or aluminum products directly must implement robust customs compliance programs to manage the tariff burden while ensuring CBP regulatory compliance.</p>

<p>California's manufacturing sector faces similar challenges across diverse industries. Manufacturers producing machinery, equipment, appliances, electronics, vehicles, and countless other products that incorporate steel or aluminum components must absorb the 50% duty on imported inputs or attempt to pass costs to customers in highly competitive markets. For manufacturers importing semi-finished steel or aluminum products for further processing in California, the tariff represents a significant competitive disadvantage compared to manufacturers in countries without comparable import duties.</p>

<p>Key compliance considerations for California construction and manufacturing companies include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Accurate HTS classification of diverse steel and aluminum products, components, and assemblies</li>
<li>Proper valuation methodologies ensuring all costs are included or excluded from customs value as required under 19 CFR Part 152</li>
<li>Maintenance of compliant records documenting the nature, quantity, value, and entry of all steel and aluminum imports</li>
<li>Implementation of internal controls preventing misclassification or origin misrepresentation</li>
<li>Evaluation of domestic sourcing alternatives where economically feasible</li>
</ul>

<h2>California Aerospace and Defense Sector Implications</h2>

<p>California's aerospace and defense industries represent critical sectors significantly impacted by the 50% Section 232 tariff increase. Major aerospace manufacturers, defense contractors, and their extensive supply chains throughout California rely on specialized steel and aluminum alloys, components, and assemblies for aircraft, spacecraft, defense systems, and related applications. The tariff increase affects both prime contractors and the thousands of small and medium-sized suppliers that comprise California's aerospace and defense industrial base.</p>

<p>Aerospace-grade aluminum alloys, specialty steel products, titanium alloys (which may contain steel or aluminum elements), and fabricated components entering California ports for aerospace and defense applications are generally subject to the 50% tariff unless specifically excluded. While national security considerations underlie the Section 232 tariff framework, the duties apply to steel and aluminum products destined for aerospace and defense applications without automatic exemption.</p>

<p>California aerospace and defense contractors face particular challenges because many aerospace materials and components are available only from foreign suppliers, domestic capacity for certain specialized products is limited or nonexistent, and qualification processes for alternative materials or suppliers can take years. Defense contractors operating under fixed-price contracts with the Department of Defense or other government agencies may lack contractual mechanisms to recover the increased costs resulting from the tariff escalation, creating significant financial exposure.</p>

<p>Compliance priorities for California aerospace and defense importers include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Precise classification of specialty alloys and aerospace-grade materials under the correct HTSUS provisions</li>
<li>Evaluation of product exclusion eligibility for critical materials lacking domestic alternatives</li>
<li>Country of origin analysis for complex supply chains involving multiple jurisdictions</li>
<li>Coordination with government customers regarding contract price adjustments where applicable</li>
<li>Implementation of enhanced recordkeeping documenting the technical specifications and applications of imported materials</li>
</ul>

<h2>HTS Classification for Steel and Aluminum Products</h2>

<p>Accurate classification of steel and aluminum products under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States is critical for California importers subject to Section 232 tariffs. Classification determines not only whether a product is subject to the 50% Section 232 duty but also the applicable column 1 normal trade relations (NTR) duty rate, eligibility for free trade agreement benefits, and statistical reporting requirements.</p>

<p>Steel products are primarily classified in HTSUS Chapter 72 (Iron and Steel) and Chapter 73 (Articles of Iron or Steel). Chapter 72 covers primary steel products such as pig iron, ferro-alloys, iron and steel in primary forms, flat-rolled products, bars and rods, wire, and angles, shapes, and sections. Chapter 73 covers articles manufactured from iron or steel, including tubes, pipes, fittings, structures, fasteners, and other fabricated products. The classification of a particular steel product depends on its form, composition, manufacturing process, and physical characteristics, requiring analysis under the General Rules of Interpretation (GRI) set forth in the HTSUS.</p>

<p>Aluminum products are primarily classified in HTSUS Chapter 76 (Aluminum and Articles Thereof), covering unwrought aluminum, aluminum bars, rods, profiles, wire, plates, sheets, strip, foil, tubes, pipes, fittings, structures, and other aluminum articles. Similar to steel classification, proper aluminum classification requires detailed analysis of product characteristics and application of the GRI.</p>

<p>Classification challenges frequently encountered by California importers include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Distinction between products classified based on material composition versus products classified based on function or use</li>
<li>Proper classification of composite products containing both steel/aluminum and other materials</li>
<li>Application of GRI 3 essential character tests when products contain multiple materials</li>
<li>Classification of sets and kits containing multiple steel or aluminum articles</li>
<li>Proper classification of semi-finished products imported for further manufacturing in California</li>
<li>Classification changes resulting from modifications to HTSUS nomenclature</li>
</ul>

<p>CBP binding ruling procedures under 19 CFR Part 177 allow California importers to obtain advance written classification determinations from CBP, providing certainty and protection against subsequent CBP classification challenges. Given the 50% duty implications of Section 232 classification, California importers should strongly consider obtaining binding rulings for significant or uncertain classifications.</p>

<h2>Country of Origin Compliance Requirements</h2>

<p>Country of origin determination is critical for California importers subject to Section 232 tariffs, particularly given the UK exception maintaining 25% duties while all other countries face 50% duties. Country of origin rules determine not only Section 232 duty rates but also marking requirements under 19 U.S.C. § 1304, applicability of other trade remedies, and statistical reporting obligations.</p>

<p>Under 19 CFR Part 134, the country of origin for marking purposes is generally the country where the article was wholly obtained or, if manufactured from materials from multiple countries, the country where the article was substantially transformed. For steel and aluminum products, substantial transformation typically occurs when manufacturing operations change the material into a new and different article with a different name, character, and use.</p>

<p>CBP applies fact-specific substantial transformation tests to determine country of origin for steel and aluminum products. Simply melting scrap metal and casting new forms in a particular country may or may not constitute substantial transformation depending on the specific processes, the nature of the input materials, and the characteristics of the finished product. California importers must conduct careful analysis of their supply chains to determine country of origin for Section 232 purposes.</p>

<p>Common country of origin compliance challenges include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Products manufactured through multi-country supply chains where different production stages occur in different countries</li>
<li>Steel or aluminum coils or other semi-finished products imported from one country but manufactured from materials originating in another country</li>
<li>Articles assembled in one country from components manufactured in multiple countries</li>
<li>Products transshipped through intermediate countries without substantial transformation</li>
<li>Products subject to minor processing, finishing, or assembly operations that do not constitute substantial transformation</li>
</ul>

<p>California importers claiming UK origin to qualify for the 25% duty rate face heightened CBP scrutiny and must maintain comprehensive documentation establishing UK origin. This documentation should include manufacturer certifications, production records, bills of materials, processing descriptions, and other evidence demonstrating that the products qualify as products of the United Kingdom under applicable substantial transformation tests. CBP may request this documentation during entry review, post-entry verification, or focused assessments targeting country of origin compliance.</p>

<h2>CBP Enforcement and Audit Risks</h2>

<p>U.S. Customs and Border Protection has designated Section 232 tariff compliance as a national enforcement priority, with particular focus on proper classification and country of origin determinations. CBP conducts enforcement activities through multiple mechanisms, all of which affect California importers processing entries at the Ports of Los Angeles, Long Beach, Oakland, and other California locations.</p>

<p>CBP enforcement mechanisms include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Entry review and examination at the time of entry, where CBP may question classification or origin claims and require additional documentation before releasing merchandise</li>
<li>Post-entry verification through CF28 requests for information, where CBP requests documentation supporting classification, valuation, or origin determinations after entry summary filing</li>
<li>Focused assessments under 19 CFR Part 151, Subpart E, where CBP conducts comprehensive audits of an importer's compliance across multiple entry areas including classification, valuation, and origin</li>
<li>Quick response audits addressing specific compliance concerns or high-risk transactions</li>
<li>Regulatory audit programs examining overall compliance program effectiveness</li>
<li>Trade enforcement investigations targeting suspected fraud, misrepresentation, or systematic noncompliance</li>
</ul>

<p>The 25-percentage-point duty differential between UK-origin products (25% duty) and products from all other countries (50% duty) creates substantial incentive for origin fraud, making country of origin a priority enforcement focus. CBP has deployed advanced analytics, supply chain mapping, and risk assessment tools to identify potentially fraudulent origin claims, transshipment schemes, and other evasion activities.</p>

<p>California importers found to have violated customs laws through negligence, gross negligence, or fraud may face penalties under 19 U.S.C. § 1592 ranging from the amount of duty loss (for negligent violations) to four times the duty loss (for fraudulent violations). Additionally, CBP may suspend or revoke importer privileges, exclude merchandise, refer matters for criminal prosecution in egregious cases, and impose enhanced monitoring requirements.</p>

<p>Given the significant penalty exposure associated with Section 232 noncompliance, California importers should implement comprehensive internal controls, conduct periodic self-assessments, and promptly disclose any identified violations through CBP's prior disclosure procedures under 19 CFR Part 162. Prior disclosure can significantly reduce or eliminate penalties for violations disclosed before CBP commences an investigation.</p>

<h2>Compliance Strategies and Legal Guidance</h2>

<p>California importers navigating the Section 232 50% tariff framework should implement comprehensive compliance strategies addressing classification, valuation, country of origin, documentation, and internal controls. Key compliance strategies include:</p>

<p><strong>Classification Review and Validation:</strong> Conduct comprehensive review of all steel and aluminum product classifications using qualified customs attorneys or classification specialists. Obtain CBP binding rulings for significant or uncertain classifications. Implement procedures ensuring new products are properly classified before first importation.</p>

<p><strong>Country of Origin Analysis:</strong> Document country of origin for all steel and aluminum products, with enhanced focus on products claimed to qualify for UK origin. Obtain manufacturer certifications establishing origin and maintain supporting documentation demonstrating substantial transformation where applicable. Avoid reliance on unverified supplier representations regarding origin.</p>

<p><strong>Supply Chain Mapping:</strong> Map steel and aluminum supply chains from raw material extraction through final production to identify all countries involved in manufacturing. Evaluate substantial transformation at each stage to determine proper origin. Identify and address risks of inadvertent transshipment or origin misrepresentation by suppliers.</p>

<p><strong>Domestic Sourcing Evaluation:</strong> Assess availability and economic feasibility of domestic steel and aluminum sources as alternatives to imports subject to 50% duties. While domestic prices have increased in response to tariff protection, in some cases domestic sourcing may provide overall cost advantages when considering tariff costs, supply chain reliability, and compliance risks.</p>

<p><strong>Product Exclusion Requests:</strong> For products where no domestic alternative exists and tariff costs threaten business viability, evaluate eligibility for product-specific exclusions through applicable exclusion request processes. While exclusion processes have been limited and unpredictable, successful exclusions can provide significant tariff relief for qualifying products.</p>

<p><strong>Compliance Program Implementation:</strong> Establish comprehensive customs compliance programs consistent with CBP's Informed Compliance framework. Implement written policies and procedures addressing classification, valuation, origin, recordkeeping, and internal controls. Designate qualified personnel responsible for customs compliance. Conduct periodic internal audits to identify and correct compliance gaps. Provide regular training to personnel involved in import operations.</p>

<p><strong>Recordkeeping:</strong> Maintain comprehensive records supporting all entry determinations for the five-year recordkeeping period required under 19 U.S.C. § 1509. Records should include commercial invoices, bills of lading, packing lists, manufacturer specifications, origin certifications, classification analyses, and correspondence with suppliers regarding product characteristics. Implement document retention systems ensuring records are readily retrievable in response to CBP requests.</p>

<p><strong>Legal Counsel Engagement:</strong> Work with experienced customs attorneys to navigate complex classification, origin, and compliance issues. Qualified legal counsel can provide advice regarding classification strategies, origin analysis, CBP audit response, prior disclosure procedures, penalty mitigation, protest procedures, and judicial review options. Particularly for California businesses importing significant volumes of steel and aluminum products, the cost of qualified legal counsel is typically far less than the cost of compliance errors, penalties, or unnecessary duty payments.</p>
