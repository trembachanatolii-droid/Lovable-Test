  title: 'Transshipment Penalties: 40% CBP Enforcement in California 2025',
  subheading: 'Understanding New Customs Penalties and Defense Strategies for California Importers',
  intro: 'In 2025, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has significantly intensified enforcement against transshipment schemes, imposing an additional ad valorem duty rate of 40 percent on articles determined to have been transshipped to evade applicable duties. This aggressive enforcement posture represents a fundamental shift in how CBP addresses country of origin violations, moving beyond traditional penalties to create substantial financial consequences designed to deter evasion schemes. California importers face particularly acute risks given that California ports—including Los Angeles, Long Beach, and Oakland—serve as primary entry points for more than 40 percent of all U.S. containerized imports. The confluence of heightened CBP scrutiny, advanced AI-powered detection systems, and Department of Justice prosecution under the False Claims Act creates an unprecedented compliance landscape for businesses importing goods through California ports. Companies throughout the state, from Silicon Valley technology firms importing electronic components to manufacturers sourcing materials from Asia, must navigate complex country of origin rules while facing the very real possibility of crippling financial penalties for violations. The stakes have never been higher for California businesses engaged in international trade, making experienced legal counsel essential to both compliance planning and defense against allegations.',

    <h2>The 40 Percent Transshipment Penalty: A New Era of CBP Enforcement</h2>
    <p>U.S. Customs and Border Protection has implemented a transformative enforcement mechanism in 2025 that imposes an additional ad valorem rate of duty of 40 percent on any article determined to have been transshipped to evade applicable duties. This penalty applies in addition to all other duties, taxes, and fees normally assessed on imported merchandise. Unlike traditional civil penalties under 19 U.S.C. § 1592, which are calculated based on loss of revenue and may be subject to negotiation and mitigation, the 40 percent transshipment penalty operates as an automatic additional duty assessment triggered by a CBP determination that transshipment occurred. This creates an immediate and substantial financial impact that can transform profitable import operations into financially devastating transactions.</p>
    <p>The severity of this penalty reflects the U.S. government's determination to combat transshipment schemes that have proliferated in recent years as importers seek to avoid Section 301 tariffs on Chinese goods and other trade remedy duties. Concerns regarding diversion or transshipment of Chinese exports have figured prominently in U.S. trade talks throughout 2025, with Mexico and Canada raising their own tariffs on Chinese goods to prevent their countries from being used as transshipment platforms. CBP's aggressive enforcement posture, supported by advanced artificial intelligence systems capable of detecting anomalous trade patterns, means California importers must approach country of origin compliance with unprecedented rigor.</p>
    <p>For California businesses, particularly those in the technology, manufacturing, and consumer goods sectors, the 40 percent penalty can exceed the actual value of the merchandise itself when combined with existing tariff rates. A Silicon Valley technology company importing electronic components subject to 25 percent Section 301 duties that CBP determines were transshipped through Vietnam to disguise Chinese origin could face a combined duty rate of 65 percent—a rate that eliminates any economic benefit from the importation and creates substantial financial liability for past entries.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Transshipment Under Federal Customs Law</h2>
    <p>Transshipment, in the context of customs enforcement, occurs when merchandise is routed through an intermediate country to disguise its true country of origin and thereby evade applicable duties, quotas, or trade restrictions. Under 19 U.S.C. § 1592, it is unlawful to enter or introduce, or attempt to enter or introduce, merchandise into the commerce of the United States by means of any document or electronically transmitted data or information, written or oral statement, or act that is material and false, or any omission that is material. False country of origin declarations constitute material false statements because they directly affect the rate of duty assessed on imported merchandise.</p>
    <p>The determination of country of origin follows specific rules established in 19 CFR 134, which generally provides that the country of origin is the country where the article was wholly grown, produced, or manufactured, or if the article consists of materials from multiple countries, the country where the article last underwent a substantial transformation. Substantial transformation occurs when an article emerges from a manufacturing process with a new name, character, and use distinct from the raw materials. California importers must understand that minimal processing, repackaging, or assembly operations in intermediate countries typically do not constitute substantial transformation sufficient to change country of origin.</p>
    <p>CBP has identified numerous transshipment schemes affecting California ports, including goods shipped from China to Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia, or Mexico where minimal processing occurs before the goods are falsely declared as products of those countries. Common red flags that trigger CBP investigations include significant increases in imports from countries with limited manufacturing capacity for the specific products, pricing inconsistent with claimed country of origin, documentation anomalies, and supply chain arrangements that lack economic logic beyond duty avoidance.</p>

    <h2>California Ports: Ground Zero for Transshipment Enforcement</h2>
    <p>California's position as the entry point for more than 40 percent of all U.S. containerized imports makes the state's ports—particularly Los Angeles, Long Beach, and Oakland—focal points for CBP transshipment enforcement efforts. These ports serve as the primary gateways for goods originating in Asia, the region where transshipment schemes most commonly originate. CBP has deployed sophisticated targeting systems at California ports that analyze import data in real-time, comparing declared country of origin against shipping patterns, manufacturer information, pricing data, and known transshipment indicators.</p>
    <p>The geographic concentration of import activity at California ports means that CBP resources are similarly concentrated, with substantial numbers of import specialists, auditors, and enforcement personnel dedicated to examining entries for potential transshipment. California importers face a higher probability of examination and audit than importers using other U.S. ports, simply due to the volume of traffic and CBP's resource allocation. This heightened scrutiny extends beyond the initial entry process to post-entry audits that may occur years after importation, examining entire import programs for patterns suggesting systematic transshipment.</p>
    <p>California businesses across multiple sectors face particular vulnerability. Technology companies in Silicon Valley importing electronic components and finished goods often source from complex Asian supply chains where Chinese components may be incorporated into products assembled in other countries. Apparel importers throughout California may receive goods where fabric or cutting occurred in China but final assembly took place in Vietnam or Cambodia. Furniture importers may encounter situations where Chinese-manufactured components are assembled in Malaysia or Mexico. In each scenario, proper country of origin determination requires careful analysis of the manufacturing process and accurate documentation.</p>

    <h2>CBP's Enhanced Detection Capabilities in 2025</h2>
    <p>CBP has dramatically enhanced its ability to detect transshipment schemes through deployment of advanced artificial intelligence and data analytics systems. These systems analyze millions of data points across multiple databases, identifying patterns and anomalies that may indicate transshipment. The technology examines shipping records, manufacturer information, pricing data, bill of lading details, container tracking information, and publicly available trade statistics to create risk profiles for individual importers, manufacturers, and shipping routes. When anomalies are detected, entries are flagged for intensive examination or audit.</p>
    <p>The AI systems can identify subtle indicators of transshipment that traditional targeting methods might miss. For example, the technology can detect when a California importer begins sourcing a product from a new country immediately after tariffs are imposed on the original source country, particularly when the new source country has limited manufacturing capacity for that product type. The systems can identify pricing inconsistencies, such as when declared values for goods allegedly manufactured in Vietnam are lower than the known cost of production in that country but consistent with Chinese manufacturing costs. Container tracking data can reveal that containers passed through Chinese ports before being shipped from the declared country of export.</p>
    <p>California importers must understand that CBP's detection capabilities extend far beyond the information contained in entry documentation. CBP has access to international shipping databases, manufacturer registration information, satellite imagery of manufacturing facilities, and intelligence sharing arrangements with foreign customs authorities. This comprehensive data access means that transshipment schemes that might have escaped detection in prior years are now likely to be identified and investigated.</p>

    <h2>Department of Justice Prosecution Under the False Claims Act</h2>
    <p>Beyond CBP administrative penalties, California importers face potential federal criminal and civil prosecution by the Department of Justice for transshipment violations. DOJ has increasingly utilized the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. § 3729, to prosecute importers who submit false country of origin declarations to evade customs duties. The False Claims Act imposes civil penalties of up to three times the government's damages plus additional statutory penalties for each false claim submitted. In the customs context, each entry of merchandise with a false country of origin declaration can constitute a separate violation, creating potential liability that dwarfs the underlying duty loss.</p>
    <p>The False Claims Act also contains qui tam provisions allowing private individuals, often employees or former employees of the importing company, to file lawsuits on behalf of the United States and share in any recovery. California businesses have seen an increase in qui tam actions filed by whistleblowers alleging systematic transshipment schemes. These actions can result in parallel criminal investigations, substantial civil penalties, and permanent damage to business relationships and reputation. Companies found liable under the False Claims Act may also face suspension or debarment from government contracting, a devastating consequence for businesses that sell to federal agencies or participate in government supply chains.</p>
    <p>DOJ prioritizes transshipment cases involving systematic schemes, substantial duty loss, and evidence of intentional evasion. California importers who discover potential country of origin issues within their organizations should immediately consult with experienced customs counsel to evaluate whether voluntary disclosure to CBP or DOJ is appropriate. Voluntary disclosure made before the government discovers the violations can significantly reduce potential penalties and may prevent criminal prosecution, but the decision to make such disclosure and the manner in which it is executed requires careful legal analysis.</p>

    <h2>Country of Origin Documentation Requirements</h2>
    <p>Compliance with country of origin rules requires California importers to implement robust documentation and verification protocols. CBP regulations require importers to exercise reasonable care in determining and declaring the correct country of origin for all imported merchandise. Reasonable care requires more than accepting supplier representations at face value; importers must conduct appropriate due diligence to verify country of origin claims, particularly when importing goods subject to high tariff rates or from regions where transshipment schemes are common.</p>
    <p>Essential documentation for establishing country of origin includes manufacturer affidavits describing the complete production process, bill of materials identifying the origin of all components, production records demonstrating where manufacturing operations occurred, and contracts with manufacturers establishing the terms of production. For products subject to substantial transformation analysis, importers should obtain detailed technical information about the manufacturing process, including descriptions of machinery used, labor inputs, and the specific operations performed in each country. California importers should conduct periodic facility visits to verify that production occurs as represented and maintain photographic evidence and third-party verification reports.</p>
    <p>When dealing with contract manufacturers or trading companies, California businesses must conduct enhanced due diligence to understand the complete supply chain. This includes investigating the actual production facilities, not merely accepting representations from intermediaries. Trading companies and exporters may themselves lack complete information about where products are manufactured or may deliberately misrepresent origin to secure sales. Importers cannot delegate their compliance obligations to foreign suppliers; ultimate responsibility for accurate country of origin declarations remains with the U.S. importer of record.</p>

    <h2>Defense Strategies Against Transshipment Allegations</h2>
    <p>California importers who receive CBP allegations of transshipment must respond strategically and immediately. The first critical step involves engaging experienced customs counsel to analyze the allegations, review the supporting evidence, and develop a comprehensive defense strategy. Timing is essential; failure to respond promptly to CBP requests for information or to notices of penalty can result in default assessments of maximum penalties with limited opportunity for subsequent challenge. Experienced counsel can often negotiate extended response deadlines and informal conferences with CBP personnel to understand the agency's evidence and theories before submitting formal responses.</p>
    <p>Effective defense strategies often focus on demonstrating that substantial transformation occurred in the declared country of origin, that the importer exercised reasonable care in determining country of origin, and that any errors were inadvertent rather than intentional. This requires marshaling detailed evidence of the manufacturing process, including technical specifications, production records, and expert analysis. In some cases, obtaining laboratory analysis or forensic examination of the merchandise itself can provide compelling evidence of where specific manufacturing operations occurred. California businesses should also gather evidence of their compliance programs, including written procedures, training records, and documentation of due diligence efforts, to demonstrate good faith efforts to comply with country of origin requirements.</p>
    <p>Penalty mitigation is a critical component of transshipment defense. Even when country of origin violations occurred, substantial penalty reductions may be available based on factors including prior disclosure, cooperation with CBP investigations, absence of prior penalties, evidence of reasonable care, and implementation of enhanced compliance measures. Experienced counsel can present mitigation arguments effectively, often reducing penalties by 50 percent or more compared to initial CBP assessments. In appropriate cases, challenging CBP determinations through administrative appeals or federal court litigation may be necessary to protect the importer's interests.</p>

    <h2>Compliance Programs for California Importers</h2>
    <p>Given the severity of transshipment penalties and the sophisticated detection capabilities CBP now deploys, California importers must implement comprehensive compliance programs specifically addressing country of origin determination. Effective programs begin with written policies and procedures that establish clear responsibilities for country of origin verification, specify required documentation, and mandate review processes before entering new supply relationships or changing sourcing countries. These procedures should require enhanced due diligence when importing products subject to Section 301 tariffs, antidumping or countervailing duties, or other trade restrictions that create significant duty rate differentials between countries.</p>
    <p>Training is essential for personnel involved in import decisions, purchasing, and entry preparation. California businesses should provide regular training covering country of origin rules, substantial transformation principles, red flags indicating potential transshipment, and documentation requirements. Training should extend beyond import compliance personnel to include purchasing agents, product development teams, and executives who make sourcing decisions. Decision-makers must understand that sourcing decisions carry customs compliance implications that can create substantial financial liability if not properly managed.</p>
    <p>Periodic internal audits provide opportunities to identify and remediate potential issues before CBP discovers them. These audits should review country of origin determinations for major product lines, examine supporting documentation for adequacy, and verify that procedures are being followed. When audits identify potential violations, California importers should work with customs counsel to evaluate whether voluntary disclosure is appropriate and to implement corrective measures. Proactive compliance management significantly reduces both the probability of violations and the severity of consequences if violations are discovered.</p>

    <h2>Impact on California Business Sectors</h2>
    <p>The 40 percent transshipment penalty and enhanced CBP enforcement affect California businesses across multiple industry sectors. The technology industry, concentrated in Silicon Valley and San Diego, faces particular challenges due to complex global supply chains where electronic components from multiple countries are assembled into finished products. These companies must carefully analyze whether assembly operations constitute substantial transformation sufficient to establish country of origin. The apparel and footwear industries, with significant California presence, must navigate scenarios where fabric, cutting, and sewing operations occur in different countries. Furniture importers throughout the state confront situations where components manufactured in one country are assembled elsewhere.</p>
    <p>California's agricultural equipment and food processing industries import machinery and components from Asian manufacturers, often through complex distribution chains that may involve intermediary countries. The automotive aftermarket industry, serving California's enormous vehicle population, imports parts that may be manufactured in multiple countries before final packaging and export. Consumer goods importers serving California's large retail market face pressure to source products cost-effectively while ensuring compliance with country of origin requirements. Each of these sectors requires tailored compliance approaches reflecting the specific supply chain structures and manufacturing processes involved.</p>
    <p>The financial impact of transshipment penalties can be existential for California businesses operating on typical import margins. When the 40 percent penalty is combined with underlying tariff rates that may themselves be 25 percent or higher, total duty rates can exceed 65 percent of merchandise value. For products that generate gross margins of 30-40 percent, such duty rates eliminate all profitability and create substantial losses. When penalties are assessed retroactively on prior entries, potentially covering several years of importations, the cumulative financial liability can exceed the company's net worth, forcing business closures or bankruptcy.</p>

    <h2>Recent Enforcement Actions and Trends</h2>
    <p>CBP enforcement actions in 2025 demonstrate the agency's commitment to aggressive transshipment prosecution at California ports. Recent cases have involved millions of dollars in penalty assessments against California importers across diverse product categories. Enforcement actions have targeted goods declared as products of Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia, and Mexico that CBP determined were actually manufactured in China and transshipped to evade Section 301 tariffs. The agency has also increased scrutiny of goods claiming origin in Central American countries under free trade agreements, particularly when the products involved categories not historically manufactured in those countries.</p>
    <p>Trends in CBP enforcement indicate that the agency is focusing on systematic schemes rather than isolated incidents. CBP examines import patterns over extended periods, looking for sudden shifts in sourcing that correlate with tariff changes, inconsistencies in pricing or specifications between products from different alleged origin countries, and relationships between U.S. importers and Chinese manufacturers that continue despite claimed sourcing from other countries. The agency uses sophisticated data analysis to identify these patterns, often initiating audits or investigations months or years after the suspected transshipment occurred. California importers must understand that passing initial entry examination does not guarantee that country of origin declarations will not be challenged in subsequent audits.</p>
    <p>International cooperation in transshipment enforcement has expanded significantly, with Mexico and Canada implementing their own measures to prevent their territories from being used as transshipment platforms for Chinese goods. These countries have raised tariffs on Chinese products and enhanced their own customs enforcement, creating additional compliance requirements for California businesses that import through North American supply chains. The coordination between U.S., Mexican, and Canadian authorities means that transshipment schemes involving routing through Mexico or Canada face enhanced detection risk and potential enforcement actions by multiple governments.</p>

    <h2>Preparing for the Future of Customs Enforcement</h2>
    <p>California importers must recognize that CBP's transshipment enforcement capabilities and commitment will continue to intensify. The agency is investing heavily in technology systems, personnel training, and international cooperation arrangements designed to detect and penalize transshipment. Future enhancements may include blockchain-based supply chain tracking, expanded information sharing with foreign customs authorities, and increased use of artificial intelligence to identify evasion schemes. California businesses that fail to prioritize country of origin compliance will face escalating risks of detection, penalty, and prosecution.</p>
    <p>Successful navigation of this enforcement environment requires viewing customs compliance as a strategic business function rather than an administrative obligation. California companies should integrate country of origin analysis into sourcing decisions, involve customs counsel in supplier selection and contract negotiation, and implement technology systems that facilitate documentation collection and verification. Building relationships with CBP through participation in trusted trader programs such as Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT) can provide benefits including reduced examination rates and access to CBP account managers who can answer compliance questions.</p>
    <p>The investment required for robust compliance programs is substantial but pales in comparison to the potential costs of transshipment penalties, False Claims Act liability, and business disruption from CBP enforcement actions. California importers should view compliance expenditures as essential insurance against catastrophic financial liability.
