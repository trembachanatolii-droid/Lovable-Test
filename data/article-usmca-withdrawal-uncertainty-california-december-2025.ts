  title: 'USMCA Withdrawal Threat December 2025: California Importers Face North American Trade Agreement Uncertainty',
  subheading: 'December 4, 2025 announcement by USTR Greer raises prospect of USMCA termination or bilateral restructuring ahead of July 2026 review, threatening $120 billion in California-Mexico-Canada trade relationships',
  intro: 'On December 4, 2025, United States Trade Representative Jamieson Greer announced that the Trump administration is actively considering withdrawal from the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, sending shockwaves through California industries dependent on North American supply chains and cross-border trade. This announcement comes as USTR conducts three-day hearings in preparation for the mandatory July 2026 USMCA joint review required under Article 34.7 of the agreement and codified at 19 U.S.C. § 4621. USTR Greer must submit a comprehensive report to Congress by early January 2026 analyzing whether to extend USMCA or pursue alternative arrangements, including the administration\'s stated interest in splitting the trilateral agreement into separate bilateral deals with Canada and Mexico. California businesses face extraordinary uncertainty affecting over $120 billion in annual trade with USMCA partners, with Mexico serving as California\'s largest trading partner at approximately $90 billion in bilateral trade and Canada representing another $30 billion. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has strongly opposed the administration\'s threat to impose 35 percent blanket tariffs on Canada and 30 percent on Mexico, arguing such measures would violate USMCA commitments under which currently 85 percent of Canada-U.S. trade and 84 percent of Mexico-U.S. trade moves tariff-free. Under USMCA Article 34.6, withdrawal becomes effective six months after written notice, creating urgent strategic planning requirements for California importers, exporters, and manufacturers dependent on North American trade relationships.',

    <h2>Administration Signals Potential USMCA Withdrawal</h2>
    <p>The December 4, 2025 statement by United States Trade Representative Jamieson Greer regarding potential USMCA withdrawal represents the most significant threat to North American trade stability since the agreement's implementation on July 1, 2020. USTR Greer's comments, delivered during three-day hearings examining the agreement's performance ahead of the mandatory July 2026 joint review, indicate the Trump administration is seriously evaluating complete withdrawal from USMCA or alternatively restructuring the trilateral framework into separate bilateral agreements with Canada and Mexico. This announcement creates immediate uncertainty for California businesses that have structured supply chains, manufacturing operations, and market access strategies around USMCA's preferential tariff treatment and rules of origin requirements established under 19 U.S.C. § 4501 et seq., the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement Implementation Act.</p>
    <p>The timing of the withdrawal threat is particularly significant given USTR Greer's statutory obligation to submit a comprehensive report to Congress by early January 2026 analyzing whether the United States should extend USMCA for an additional sixteen years or allow the agreement to enter annual review cycles under Article 34.7. The three-day hearings conducted in December 2025 provided the first formal opportunity for industry stakeholders, labor organizations, agricultural interests, and trade associations to present views on USMCA's performance and potential modifications. California industry representatives emphasized the state's massive economic stake in continued USMCA benefits, with testimony highlighting integrated automotive supply chains through the San Diego-Tijuana border region, agricultural exports to Canadian and Mexican markets, technology sector reliance on digital trade provisions, and manufacturing operations dependent on duty-free movement of components and finished goods across North American borders.</p>
    <p>The administration's consideration of USMCA withdrawal occurs against the backdrop of broader tariff escalation policies, including the December 2025 threats of 35 percent blanket tariffs on Canadian imports and 30 percent blanket tariffs on Mexican imports. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and numerous industry associations have argued that such across-the-board tariffs would directly violate USMCA Article 2.4 commitments to eliminate tariffs on originating goods, potentially triggering dispute settlement proceedings under Chapter 31 of the agreement or retaliatory measures by Canada and Mexico. Currently, approximately 85 percent of U.S.-Canada trade and 84 percent of U.S.-Mexico trade enters duty-free under USMCA preferences, providing substantial cost advantages to businesses that qualify products under the agreement's rules of origin. Imposition of blanket tariffs would eliminate these benefits even if USMCA formally remains in force, fundamentally altering the trade relationship that California businesses have relied upon for over five years.</p>

    <h2>USMCA Legal Framework and Withdrawal Provisions</h2>
    <p>The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement contains explicit withdrawal provisions in Article 34.6, which provides that any party may withdraw from the agreement by providing written notice to the other parties. Withdrawal becomes effective six months after such written notice is delivered, creating a six-month transition period during which the agreement would continue to govern trade relationships while businesses prepare for the post-USMCA environment. For California importers and exporters, this six-month period would require rapid restructuring of supply chains, renegotiation of commercial contracts, evaluation of alternative duty relief mechanisms, and strategic decisions about continued North American operations versus diversification to other markets or reshoring to domestic facilities.</p>
    <p>USMCA was implemented in the United States through the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement Implementation Act, Public Law 116-113, codified at 19 U.S.C. § 4501 et seq. This implementing legislation provides the statutory framework for USMCA's operation, including rules of origin requirements in 19 U.S.C. § 4531 et seq., customs procedures in 19 U.S.C. § 4541 et seq., and enforcement provisions throughout Chapter 29 of Title 19. Presidential withdrawal from USMCA would terminate the agreement's international obligations six months after notice, but would also require Congressional action or presidential proclamation to modify the implementing legislation and restore most-favored-nation duty rates that applied prior to USMCA's entry into force for goods from Canada and Mexico.</p>
    <p>The legal mechanics of USMCA withdrawal would involve multiple steps affecting California businesses. First, the President would provide written notice of withdrawal to Canada and Mexico under Article 34.6. Second, during the six-month notice period, USMCA would continue to govern trade relationships and California importers could continue claiming preferential tariff treatment under the agreement's rules of origin provided in 19 C.F.R. Part 182. Third, upon the effective date of withdrawal, goods from Canada and Mexico would become subject to Column 1 most-favored-nation duty rates under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States unless alternative trade arrangements were negotiated and implemented. Fourth, U.S. Customs and Border Protection would need to modify entry processing systems, eliminate USMCA-specific procedures, and provide guidance to importers regarding documentation requirements and duty assessment for post-withdrawal entries. California businesses processing entries through the Ports of Los Angeles, Long Beach, San Diego, Oakland, and other California entry points would face immediate operational changes affecting every import transaction from Canada and Mexico.</p>

    <h2>December 2025 Hearings and Congressional Report Requirements</h2>
    <p>The three-day hearings conducted by USTR in December 2025 serve as the primary mechanism for gathering stakeholder input to inform the comprehensive report that USTR Greer must submit to Congress by early January 2026. This report will analyze USMCA's economic impacts, implementation successes and challenges, and recommendations regarding whether to extend the agreement for an additional sixteen years under Article 34.7 or pursue alternative approaches including potential withdrawal or bilateral restructuring. The hearings featured testimony from diverse interests including automotive manufacturers, agricultural producers, labor unions, technology companies, retail associations, manufacturers' groups, and individual businesses operating cross-border supply chains dependent on USMCA benefits.</p>
    <p>California stakeholders presented extensive testimony highlighting the state's unique dependence on USMCA-facilitated trade. Automotive sector representatives from Southern California emphasized integrated manufacturing operations spanning the U.S.-Mexico border, with components crossing multiple times during production processes that rely on USMCA's rules of origin allowing duty-free movement when products meet 75 percent regional value content requirements for passenger vehicles under Annex 4-B. Agricultural interests testified regarding California's over $4 billion in annual agricultural exports to USMCA partners, including dairy products, almonds, pistachios, wine, fresh produce, and processed foods that benefit from preferential market access. Technology sector representatives stressed the importance of USMCA Chapter 19 digital trade provisions prohibiting customs duties on digital products and restricting data localization requirements that enable California companies to operate integrated North American platforms and services.</p>
    <p>The January 2026 congressional report will provide the first official indication of the administration's intentions regarding USMCA's future. If the report recommends extending the agreement for sixteen years, this would signal continuity subject to potential modifications negotiated during the July 2026 joint review. If the report questions USMCA's value or recommends major restructuring, California businesses should prepare for either wholesale agreement renegotiation, conversion to bilateral frameworks, or potential complete withdrawal. The report's analysis of specific sectoral impacts, particularly regarding automotive rules of origin, agricultural market access, and digital trade provisions, will provide critical insight into which USMCA elements the administration views as successful and which may face modification or elimination. California companies should review the report carefully upon its release and engage immediately with industry associations, congressional representatives, and qualified trade counsel to develop response strategies protecting their interests in subsequent negotiation or withdrawal processes.</p>

    <h2>Impact on California Industries and Cross-Border Trade</h2>
    <p>California's economy faces disproportionate exposure to USMCA withdrawal or major restructuring given the state's position as the nation's largest international trading hub and its particularly close integration with Mexican supply chains and Canadian markets. California's bilateral goods trade with Mexico exceeded $90 billion in 2024, making Mexico the state's largest trading partner and accounting for approximately 30 percent of California's total international merchandise trade. Canada represents another $30 billion in bilateral trade, concentrated in energy products, forest products, agricultural goods, and manufactured items. Combined, USMCA partners account for nearly 40 percent of California's international trade, creating massive exposure to any changes in the preferential tariff treatment, rules of origin, or market access provisions that USMCA currently provides.</p>
    <p>The threat of USMCA withdrawal creates immediate challenges across California's diverse industrial base. The automotive sector, concentrated in Southern California with extensive supply chain integration across the San Diego-Tijuana border, relies on USMCA rules of origin that allow vehicles and components meeting regional value content requirements to move duty-free. Column 1 MFN duty rates on passenger vehicles from Mexico would be 2.5 percent under HTSUS heading 8703, while automotive parts face duty rates ranging from duty-free to 25 percent depending on specific product classification. While these rates are lower than tariffs on many other products, the reimposition of duties on the massive volume of automotive trade between California and Mexico would significantly impact cost structures, potentially making some integrated operations uncompetitive compared to purely domestic production or manufacturing in other regions.</p>
    <p>California agriculture faces severe market access risks from USMCA withdrawal. Mexican tariffs on U.S. agricultural products were substantially reduced or eliminated under NAFTA and continued under USMCA, providing California producers with competitive advantages over suppliers from other countries. If USMCA terminates without a replacement agreement, Mexico could reimpose tariffs on California agricultural exports or grant preferential treatment to products from other countries with which Mexico maintains trade agreements. California dairy producers, tree nut exporters, wine producers, and fresh produce growers could face immediate competitive disadvantages in the Mexican market, while Canadian supply management systems could restrict access for California dairy and poultry products without USMCA market access commitments. The loss of preferential treatment for California agricultural exports could cost the state billions in market share and force painful adjustments throughout California's agricultural sector.</p>
    <p>California's technology sector depends heavily on USMCA Chapter 19 digital trade provisions that prohibit customs duties on digital products, restrict data localization requirements, and protect source code from forced disclosure. These provisions enable California technology companies, entertainment firms, and digital service providers to operate integrated North American platforms without fragmenting infrastructure or maintaining separate systems for each country. USMCA withdrawal would eliminate these protections, potentially exposing California technology companies to tariffs on software, digital content, and online services, as well as data localization mandates that would require establishing Canadian and Mexican data centers and substantially increase operational costs. For Silicon Valley firms, Los Angeles entertainment companies, and San Diego biotechnology and life sciences companies relying on cross-border data flows, USMCA withdrawal would create fundamental challenges to current business models and competitive positioning in North American markets.</p>

    <h2>Automotive Sector Implications and Regional Value Content Requirements</h2>
    <p>California's automotive sector stands among the industries most vulnerable to USMCA withdrawal or major restructuring given the sector's dependence on integrated U.S.-Mexico supply chains and complex rules of origin calculations under USMCA Chapter 4 and Annex 4-B. Current USMCA requirements mandate that passenger vehicles contain 75 percent regional value content calculated under the net cost method specified in 19 C.F.R. § 182.53, with additional requirements that 70 percent of steel and aluminum purchases originate in North America and that 40-45 percent of vehicle content be produced by workers earning at least sixteen dollars per hour under the Labor Value Content provisions unique to USMCA.</p>
    <p>Southern California hosts extensive automotive manufacturing and supplier operations with deep integration across the U.S.-Mexico border. The San Diego-Tijuana region operates as a single automotive production zone, with components and subassemblies crossing the border multiple times during manufacturing processes that depend on USMCA's rules of origin allowing duty-free movement when overall regional content thresholds are met. Manufacturing facilities throughout Los Angeles, Orange County, and the Inland Empire source labor-intensive components from Mexican suppliers, with just-in-time delivery through border crossings that process thousands of commercial vehicles daily carrying automotive parts and assemblies qualifying under USMCA rules of origin.</p>
    <p>USMCA withdrawal would force California automotive operations to choose between accepting MFN duty rates on Mexican-sourced components and vehicles, restructuring supply chains to source more content domestically or from duty-free suppliers, or relocating operations entirely to avoid customs duties on cross-border movements. The 2.5 percent MFN duty rate on passenger vehicles appears modest in isolation, but when applied to the massive volume of automotive trade between California and Mexico, represents hundreds of millions of dollars in annual duty costs. More significantly, automotive parts face varying duty rates, with some critical components subject to substantial duties that would make cross-border supply chains uneconomical compared to fully domestic or fully Mexican production that avoids duty costs on intermediate movements.</p>
    <p>The administration's discussion of potentially splitting USMCA into separate bilateral agreements with Canada and Mexico creates additional automotive sector uncertainty. If bilateral U.S.-Mexico and U.S.-Canada agreements retain rules of origin similar to current USMCA provisions but eliminate the trilateral framework, vehicles and components containing Canadian and Mexican content might face challenges qualifying for preferential treatment. Current USMCA rules allow content from all three member countries to count toward regional value content calculations, enabling vehicles assembled in the United States with Mexican-manufactured components and Canadian-sourced materials to qualify as originating goods. Separate bilateral agreements might require that vehicles meet regional content thresholds based only on U.S. and Mexican content for U.S.-Mexico trade or only U.S. and Canadian content for U.S.-Canada trade, potentially disqualifying vehicles and components that currently meet trilateral requirements. California automotive companies should conduct scenario analysis examining how their supply chains would perform under various bilateral agreement structures compared to current trilateral USMCA rules.</p>

    <h2>Agricultural Trade Under Threat: California Export Exposure</h2>
    <p>California agriculture faces extraordinary risks from USMCA withdrawal given the state's position as the nation's leading agricultural exporter and heavy dependence on preferential access to Mexican and Canadian markets. California exported over $4 billion in agricultural and food products to USMCA partners in 2024, including dairy products, tree nuts, wine, fresh produce, processed foods, and agricultural inputs. USMCA provides duty-free or preferential tariff treatment for these products under tariff schedules negotiated through NAFTA and continued under USMCA, giving California producers competitive advantages over suppliers from countries without preferential access to North American markets.</p>
    <p>The dairy sector represents a particularly vulnerable California agricultural segment given its dual exposure to both Mexican export markets and Canadian import competition. California dairy producers export substantial volumes of cheese, ultra-filtered milk, butter, milk powder, and other products to Mexico, where they benefit from duty-free treatment under USMCA. Simultaneously, California dairy producers compete with Canadian dairy imports in the U.S. market, where Canadian products also enter duty-free under USMCA but are subject to supply management systems that limit Canadian production volumes. USMCA withdrawal would eliminate duty-free treatment for California dairy exports to Mexico while potentially allowing Mexico to grant preferential treatment to dairy products from other countries with which Mexico maintains trade agreements, placing California producers at a competitive disadvantage. Additionally, without USMCA constraints on Canadian dairy exports to the United States, California dairy producers could face increased import competition from Canadian products no longer subject to agreed market access limits.</p>
    <p>California tree nut producers, including almond and pistachio growers who export billions of dollars of product to global markets annually, benefit significantly from USMCA duty-free access to Mexico and Canada. Mexican tariffs on tree nuts from non-USMCA countries create price advantages for California exporters, while Canadian market access enables California producers to compete effectively against domestic Canadian production and imports from other sources. If USMCA terminates, California tree nut exporters could face reimposed tariffs in Mexican markets or preferential treatment for competitors from countries with which Mexico and Canada maintain other trade agreements. Given the commodity nature of tree nuts and the price sensitivity of international markets, even modest tariff disadvantages could cost California producers substantial market share in North American export markets that represent critical outlets for the state's massive tree nut production.</p>
    <p>California wine producers have developed substantial export businesses to Canadian and Mexican markets under NAFTA and USMCA preferential tariff treatment. Canadian wine consumers have shown strong demand for California products, while Mexico's growing middle class has increased consumption of imported premium wines. USMCA withdrawal would expose California wine exports to potential tariff reimposition and competitive disadvantages compared to wine from other countries with which Canada and Mexico maintain preferential trade arrangements. Additionally, California wine producers benefit from USMCA provisions addressing technical barriers to trade, labeling requirements, and sanitary and phytosanitary measures that facilitate market access. Without USMCA's disciplines on regulatory barriers, California wine exporters could face new obstacles to market access even beyond tariff considerations, including discriminatory labeling requirements, restrictive distribution regulations, or other non-tariff barriers that effectively limit California wine exports to Canadian and Mexican markets.</p>

    <h2>Potential Separate Bilateral Agreements: Implications and Uncertainties</h2>
    <p>The Trump administration's stated interest in potentially splitting USMCA into separate bilateral agreements with Canada and Mexico introduces additional complexity and uncertainty beyond simple withdrawal scenarios. Bilateral U.S.-Mexico and U.S.-Canada agreements could theoretically replicate many USMCA provisions while allowing differentiated approaches to issues where U.S. interests diverge between the two trading partners. However, the transition from a trilateral framework to bilateral structures would create substantial challenges for California businesses operating integrated North American supply chains that rely on trilateral content accumulation and cumulation provisions under current USMCA rules.</p>
    <p>Under current USMCA rules of origin, materials and components from any USMCA country can be combined and counted toward regional value content calculations, enabling complex supply chains where vehicles assembled in the United States contain Mexican-manufactured components and Canadian-sourced materials, with all North American content counting toward the 75 percent RVC threshold. Separate bilateral agreements would likely require that products meet regional content requirements based only on content from the two parties to each bilateral agreement. A vehicle assembled in California containing Mexican components and Canadian materials might fail to qualify under both a U.S.-Mexico bilateral agreement (because Canadian content would not count) and a U.S.-Canada bilateral agreement (because Mexican content would not count), even though the same vehicle easily qualifies under current trilateral USMCA rules where all North American content is cumulated.</p>
    <p>California businesses should recognize that bilateral agreements could also enable differentiated tariff treatment and rules of origin between U.S.-Mexico and U.S.-Canada trade. The administration might seek higher regional value content requirements for U.S.-Mexico trade in automotive products while maintaining current 75 percent thresholds for U.S.-Canada automotive trade, or vice versa. Agricultural provisions could differ substantially, with potentially enhanced market access for U.S. dairy products to Canada in exchange for concessions in other sectors, while U.S.-Mexico agricultural trade might focus on seasonal produce mechanisms or other issues specific to that relationship. Digital trade provisions, labor standards, environmental commitments, and dispute settlement mechanisms could all vary between bilateral agreements, creating complex compliance challenges for California companies operating in both relationships.</p>
    <p>The negotiation timeline for bilateral agreements replacing USMCA remains uncertain. If the administration provides notice of USMCA withdrawal in early 2026, the six-month effective date would fall in mid-2026, shortly after the July 1, 2026 scheduled joint review. Whether bilateral agreements could be negotiated, finalized, and implemented before USMCA withdrawal becomes effective is highly questionable given the complexity of trade negotiations and Congressional consideration required for implementing legislation. California businesses should prepare for potential scenarios where USMCA terminates before replacement bilateral agreements enter into force, creating a gap period where trade with Canada and Mexico occurs under MFN terms without preferential treatment. This gap period could last months or even years depending on negotiation complexity and Congressional action timelines, forcing California importers and exporters to operate without the preferential access and duty treatment that has characterized North American trade for over three decades under NAFTA and USMCA.</p>

    <h2>Current Section 232 Tariffs and Potential Blanket Tariff Threats</h2>
    <p>The December 2025 USMCA withdrawal discussions occur against the backdrop of existing Section 232 tariffs on steel and aluminum from Canada and Mexico, as well as administration threats to impose 35 percent blanket tariffs on Canada and 30 percent blanket tariffs on Mexico. Understanding the interaction between Section 232 tariffs, potential blanket tariffs, and USMCA provisions is essential for California businesses assessing total duty exposure and trade policy trajectories affecting North American commerce.</p>
    <p>Section 232 tariffs on steel and aluminum, imposed under presidential authority in 19 U.S.C. § 1862 based on national security considerations, currently apply to steel and aluminum articles from Canada and Mexico despite USMCA commitments. While USMCA Article 2.4 requires elimination of tariffs on originating goods, the agreement includes exceptions for measures necessary for national security under Article 32.2, which incorporates GATT Article XXI national security exceptions. The administration has maintained that Section 232 tariffs fall within this national security exception, though Canada and Mexico have challenged this interpretation. For California importers of steel and aluminum products from USMCA partners, the combination of Section 232 tariffs and normal customs duties creates substantial total duty burdens even while USMCA remains in force.</p>
    <p>The administration's December 2025 threats to impose 35 percent blanket tariffs on Canadian imports and 30 percent blanket tariffs on Mexican imports would represent a fundamental departure from USMCA Article 2.4 commitments to eliminate tariffs on originating goods. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and industry associations have argued that such across-the-board tariffs would violate USMCA obligations and could trigger formal dispute settlement proceedings under USMCA Chapter 31, potentially resulting in findings that the United States has breached its obligations and authorizing Canada and Mexico to impose retaliatory measures. However, if such blanket tariffs are imposed under Section 232 national security authority or other statutory mechanisms that the administration argues fall outside USMCA disciplines, the legal analysis becomes more complex and uncertain.</p>
    <p>For California businesses, blanket tariffs at 30-35 percent would devastate the economics of cross-border trade and integrated supply chains even if USMCA technically remains in force. California importers currently enjoying duty-free treatment for Mexican and Canadian goods meeting USMCA rules of origin would face massive cost increases affecting competitiveness, supply chain viability, and market positioning. The combination of blanket tariffs, existing Section 232 steel and aluminum duties, and potential USMCA withdrawal would create the most restrictive North American trade environment since before NAFTA's 1994 implementation, forcing fundamental reassessment of California business strategies dependent on North American market integration. Companies should begin scenario planning examining operational impacts of 30-35 percent blanket tariffs combined with potential USMCA withdrawal, developing contingency plans for supply chain restructuring, domestic sourcing expansion, or alternative market strategies that reduce dependence on duty-free North American trade currently enabled by USMCA.</p>

    <h2>Compliance Strategies During Uncertainty: Managing Risk and Positioning for Change</h2>
    <p>California businesses face the challenge of maintaining USMCA compliance and maximizing current benefits while preparing for potential agreement withdrawal, major restructuring, or conversion to bilateral frameworks. Strategic compliance approaches during this uncertainty period should address multiple scenarios while protecting against regulatory violations and unnecessary duty costs under current USMCA rules that remain in force until any withdrawal becomes effective.</p>
    <p>First, California importers should conduct comprehensive audits of current USMCA qualification positions, examining whether products currently entered claiming USMCA preferential tariff treatment actually meet all rules of origin requirements under 19 C.F.R. Part 182. This audit should include verification of regional value content calculations, review of supplier certifications, confirmation of tariff classification accuracy, and validation of origin determinations. Given the enhanced CBP enforcement environment and potential for increased scrutiny of USMCA claims during the withdrawal discussion period, California importers should ensure all current USMCA claims are fully supportable and documented. Any identified deficiencies should be addressed through corrective entries, prior disclosures under 19 C.F.R. Part 162, or modifications to qualification approaches before CBP initiates audits or enforcement actions.</p>
    <p>Second, businesses should develop scenario models examining financial and operational impacts under various potential outcomes including USMCA continuation with current provisions, USMCA modification with enhanced regional content requirements or other changes, USMCA withdrawal with reversion to MFN duty rates, bilateral agreements with cumulation limitations, and blanket tariff imposition at various rate levels. For each scenario, companies should quantify impacts on duty costs, landed costs, supply chain expenses, and overall competitiveness. This analysis enables informed strategic decisions about whether to invest in supply chain restructuring to maintain North American orientation, accept higher duty costs and compete on other factors, pursue alternative duty mitigation strategies such as foreign trade zones under 19 U.S.C. § 81c, or fundamentally restructure operations to reduce North American trade dependence.</p>
    <p>Third, California businesses should engage actively in the policy process through direct submissions to USTR, participation in industry association advocacy efforts, and coordination with California congressional representatives. While the formal comment period for the January 2026 USTR report has closed, ongoing opportunities exist to inform U.S. negotiating positions regarding USMCA's future. California companies possess valuable information about supply chain realities, competitive dynamics, employment impacts, and practical consequences of various policy options. Providing this information to policymakers through congressional testimony, meetings with USTR officials, industry coalition participation, and media engagement helps ensure that decisions regarding USMCA's future reflect understanding of real-world impacts on California businesses and workers.</p>
    <p>Fourth, companies should review commercial contracts with suppliers, customers, and logistics providers to understand allocation of duty cost risks under various scenarios. Many contracts include force majeure provisions, price adjustment mechanisms, or other terms addressing unforeseen regulatory changes. California businesses should evaluate whether existing contract terms adequately protect against USMCA withdrawal scenarios or require renegotiation. Contracts being negotiated now should explicitly address potential duty changes resulting from USMCA modifications or withdrawal, clarifying whether suppliers or customers will bear increased costs and under what conditions contracts may be terminated or renegotiated in response to trade policy changes.</p>
